[Brandon Bolling](https://Intagram/bbolling82) is a college student at [Allegheny College](https://emberjs.com/team). I am looking to double major in Integrative Informatics, as well as Environmental Science and Sustainability. This site is a collection of all my life photos, starting from the beginning. I will leave a feedback form in case you have any questions or suggestions, thanks!
